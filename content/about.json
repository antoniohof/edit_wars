  "aboutcontext_ru": "Since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, the Russian state has blocked Russian users’ access to more than 3,000 websites, including all independent media pages, as well as closing access to Instagram, Facebook and Twitter. Information control was tightened through the revocation of media licenses, legislation on foreign agents and undesirable organizations, and criminal and administrative prosecution of journalists.\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\nRussian authorities label as \"fake\" any information about the war that does not correspond to official reports from the Ministry of Defense. In March 2022, a law on fakes and a law on discrediting the Russian army were passed, and they became the basis for numerous administrative and criminal cases. People receive penalties ranging from fines to 10 years in prison for publicly condemning the war in Ukraine.\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\nRestrictions on freedom of speech and the monopolization of the information space have allowed the Russian state to place most of its own citizens in an information bubble. It is a parallel distorted reality, filled endlessly with propaganda narratives and state-friendly interpretations of events.\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\nNarrative in this context is understood as a communicative tool – a self-created story about a set of interrelated events. It offers an alternative form of history that can be used to interpret reality. Narrative can describe history by embellishing the causes and development of an event, creating characters and building on underlying myths, cultural imperatives and traditions.\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\nThis project is based on data analysis of propaganda narratives created and reproduced by the Russian state-approved digital media from January to July 2022. The Edit Wars team explored which key themes, messages and propaganda techniques formed a parallel reality for the Russian audience after the invasion of Ukraine. Using the GDELT Global Difference Graph (GDG) databases, we analyzed more than 500,000 headlines from Russian-language media with machine learning tools to show and explain to the world community how the war in Ukraine is covered by Russian propaganda.\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27Ikwe8kKPo\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: grey\"><ins>EDIT WARS SHORT PRESENTATION<ins></a>",
  "aboutmain_en": "Edit Wars is a project using the analysis of media publications accompanying the growing militarization and manipulation of mass consciousness in Russia for a better understanding of the mechanics of state propaganda and ways to build resilience towards it. The project focuses on the use of aggressive narratives in the government-controlled media that isolate public perception from the real state of affairs.",
